The raffle Ubercart module allows the store administrator to designate one or more product classes that should be treated
as raffle tickets. When a product from a product class that has been designated as a raffle ticket is checked out by a
customer, a unique code for each ticket purchased will be generated and emailed to the user.

There is a report which lists all of the generated codes per product available, this can be accessed from the store menu
in the reports section (it is called "Raffle report").

There are some settings for the module under Raffle in the Configuration section of the store page. You can modify the
subject line of the email sent to users and select which product classes have raffle ticket functionality.
